Subject: [PATCH 22/58] sched: Make energy awareness a sched feature

This patch introduces the ENERGY_AWARE sched feature, which is
implemented using jump labels when SCHED_DEBUG is defined. It is
statically set false when SCHED_DEBUG is not defined. Hence this doesn't
allow energy awareness to be enabled without SCHED_DEBUG. This
sched_feature knob will be replaced later with a more appropriate
control knob when things have matured a bit.

ENERGY_AWARE is based on per-entity load-tracking hence FAIR_GROUP_SCHED
must be enable. This dependency isn't checked at compile time yet.
